### Version 12.13 [ November 17th 2020 ]

**Early Message:**  
Real Change Log coming soon.. Servers went up early. This is for 9.0.2, the main change in this version is the way scaling works in the UI, using any scaling size you prefer should work much, much better. However, this is new and it still needs a little adjusting but overall experience with scaling should be a ton better. Also, the Unified Fonts setting was further adjusted to be exactly as it was pre-font changes.  

**Epic:**  
The new scaling adjustments are in place, which should allow you to select a custom scale that will keep borders intact better. This comes with new Small Medium and Large buttons to quickly adjust the scale *(Reload is required to properly change scale)*.  
Unified Font setting is now replicating old behaviour entirely.  
Druid multicrafting castbar is now fixed.  

**Rare:**  
All Individual Unitframes were given Detached Power Bar setting.  
Currency Icons have a little border of their own now.  
Pet bar saturation would sometimes become stuck, it is now unstuck.  
Group Finder eye icon was sometimes behind the button itself, we moved the eyeball up some.  
Fixed up the Hide Button Glow on ActionBars, it was a bit funky before when implemented.  
Time Datatext can now be used in multiple areas without getting confused about what time it actually is.  
Bags Item Level should be more accurate again.  
Chat has a Server Time setting now which can be used instead of Local Time.  
Target Aura Bars attached to Player Aura Bars should be offset correctly.  
Addon Manager skin was adjusted to allow searching by other addons.  
Added Top and Bottom for Custom Text on ActionBars.  
Fixed another Quest Skin but which prevented the Parchment from being shown sometimes with Parchment Remover disabled.  

___

### Version 12.12 [ November 10th 2020 ]

**Woot:**  
Level Locked Spells on Action Bars will display more clearly when doing older instances with friends on a higher level character.  
Masque on Action Bars should once again trim correctly (when Keep Aspect Ratio is checked). The logic was a little off before. Should be okay now.  
Quest Icons on NamePlates would sometimes show the incorrect Icon on some mobs, this logic has been adjusted.  
The Quest Seal Color Text with Parchment Remover enabled should be more visible.  
Added custom font count and hotkey text options for Action Bars (Thanks @Caedis).  
Added custom color options for Cast Bars on UnitFrames (Thanks @Caedis).  
Increased the Cast Bar text offset options on UnitFrames.  
A couple Top Aura font issues resolved.  

___

### Version 12.11 [ November 7th 2020 ]

**Sweet:**  
The Keybinds for disabled ActionBars will work again! Sorry this was overlooked.  
Corrected Count Font Outline on Top Auras, along with the border color being incorrect. Also, Apply All Fonts will a work for these again.  
Implemented a work around for the Quest Objective Tracker Icon being unusable sometimes in combat.  
Added a toggle for Action Button Glow incase you don't want to see procs happening.  
Seals were showing when Parchment Remover was enabled, should be hidden again now.  
Fixed the Mend Pet spell ID for Aura indicator on Pet.  
Added Show Level option for EXP Databar.  

___

### Version 12.10 [ November 6th 2020 ]

**Hotfix:**

Top Aura options were reworked and settings for them were reset.  
Added Custom Font options for Unitframe Castbars (Thanks @Caedis).  

___

### Version 12.09 [ November 6th 2020 ]

**Sweet:**  
Nameplates were reset in the last version for some people who had a newer profile, sorry about that. That problem is corrected now.  
**/kb** was upgraded to also work on the microbar and bag items. You can now quickly bind from the Spell (binds by the Spell name) and Macro (binds by the Macro name), on Action buttons (binds to slot), or directly on Bag items (binds by Item ID, not the slot).  

**Nice:**  
Quest Most Expensive Item icon is behaving now.  
Shadowed Unitframes wasn't playing nicely, should be okay now.  
Masque should play nicely again. However noting that unchecking Keep Aspect Ratio will affect Masque icons, keep it on if you want it to use the one intended for the skin you have selected.  

**Okay:**  
Exp Databar would error sometimes.  
Microbar Visibility option would error sometimes.  
Adjustments to the Quest Skin to try to keep the text and backgrounds showing properly (again).  
Fixed Classbar being tiny when using AutoHide option, also would error when leaving a vehicle.  
Actionbar Button Spacing option can once again be set to up to -3.  
Added Party Indicator option for Unitframes (Thanks @Caedis).  
Backdrop on the Stance bar wasn't using the correct multiplier when less than the amount of buttons available.  
Backdrop on the Microbar was a little off, that is sorted.  
Added Honor Level to Honor bar text outputs.  
Fixed the last tick on castbars.  

___

### Version 12.08 [ November 2nd 2020 ]

Ungoofed the Nameplate Thin Border option (under *General > Media > Borders*).  
Removed ultra rare hidden error with how we spawn the Talking Head Frame.  
Tweaked "Unified Font Sizes" a little more to mimic the older style and disabled it by default.  
Supressed the error when you dont have Pawn updated yet, go update it if you use it! :)  

___

### Version 12.07 [ November 1st 2020 ]

**Nice:**  
Added new "Unified Font Sizes" setting for "Replace Blizzard Fonts" (on by default). A decent amount of you didn't seem to like the change this hopefully will make you love us again. <3  
Actionbar Buttons can be sized unproportionally now by unchecking the Keep Size Ratio option. This will let you make an EPIC looking bar.  
HelpTips will now be hidden with Hide Tutorials, even while in combat (it was protected for safety but seems okay without it).  
Added an option for Ultrawide monitors to be 16:9 like eyefinity would do but on one monitor (Thanks @Gholie).  
Microbar can have a backdrop like ActionBars now.
